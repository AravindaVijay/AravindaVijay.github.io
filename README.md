As a graduate student in Data Science at The George Washington University, I am passionate about applying my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems using data. 

Before enrolling in GWU, I worked as an Application Development Analyst at Accenture for over a year, where I developed and deployed software solutions for clients in various domains, such as healthcare, and retail. I also have experience as an Associate Software Engineer and an Intern at the Indian Institute of Science, where I worked on quantum communication and channel capacity of optical links. 

I have a strong background in programming, data analysis, and machine learning, with proficiency in Python, SQL, R, and MATLAB. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore. 

My goal is to become a data scientist who can leverage data to generate insights, optimize processes, and create value for organizations and society. I am eager to learn from and collaborate with other data enthusiasts and experts, and to contribute to the advancement of data science.
