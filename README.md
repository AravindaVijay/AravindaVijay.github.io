As a graduate student in Data Science at The George Washington University, I am passionate about applying my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems using data. 

Before enrolling in GWU, I worked as an Application Development Analyst at Accenture for over a year, where I developed and deployed software solutions for clients in various domains, such as healthcare, and retail. I also have experience as an Associate Software Engineer and an Intern at the Indian Institute of Science, where I worked on quantum communication and channel capacity of optical links. 

I have a strong background in programming, data analysis, and machine learning, with proficiency in Python, SQL, R, and MATLAB. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore. 

My goal is to become a data scientist who can leverage data to generate insights, optimize processes, and create value for organizations and society. I am eager to learn from and collaborate with other data enthusiasts and experts, and to contribute to the advancement of data science.

<p>In today's data-driven world, the demand for fast and scalable graph databases is rapidly increasing. As organizations rely more on graph data models to represent complex relationships, understanding the performance characteristics of these databases becomes crucial.</p>

<p>This project dives deep into the performance comparison of two prominent graph databases: Neo4j and Ontotext GraphDB, with a specific focus on RDF data processing. The objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of their capabilities and challenges through systematic time evaluations.</p>

<p>The study delves into essential aspects such as traversal efficiency and query processing times across varying data sizes and complexities. By using Cypher for Neo4j and SPARQL for GraphDB queries, we aim to offer a nuanced view of how these databases perform in different scenarios.</p>

<p>This project serves as a valuable resource for developers, data engineers, and organizations seeking insights into the performance nuances of graph databases, particularly when dealing with RDF data processing.</p>

<p>This project is a deep dive into the world of music streaming platform spotify, aiming to analyze the intricate characteristics of songs to gain valuable insights that can enhance user experiences. Within the vast catalog of tracks available on Spotify, the focus is on identifying patterns and connections among diverse audio attributes. The main objectives include predicting song popularity, crafting personalized playlists, and ultimately improving overall user satisfaction.

This analysis utilizes robust machine learning models such as k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, XGBoost, and others to delve into the detailed elements of songs. By scrutinizing the distributions of audio features and uncovering correlations, the aim is to reveal the inherent patterns that define genres and captivate audiences. These models not only predict a songâ€™s genre but also offer a nuanced understanding of how different audio attributes contribute to its appeal.

Additionally, the project extends its exploration into the realm of danceability, a core aspect of music that often transcends genre boundaries. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression analysis are employed to grasp the influence of various features on danceability. Through this analytical journey, the project seeks to uncover the hidden intricacies within musical compositions, decoding the complex relationships between audio features, genres, and danceability to offer predictive insights and a deeper appreciation for the artistry of music.</p>
